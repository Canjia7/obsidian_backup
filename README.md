This is the synchronized backup of my notes organized using the *Obsidian* software. Most of it is notes from my reading of papers in the field of computer graphics.
# Usage:
Use `git clone` to download this folder to the local, and select this folder as the repository when initializing the *Obsidian* software.
If the images in the notes cannot be correctly recognized by *Markdown*, you can move the contents of the *Pic* folder to the project root directory, or add `"../Pic/"` before the image path in the md file.
